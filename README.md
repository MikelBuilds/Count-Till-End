# ✨ Count till End - Watch Time Fly! ✨

**(Formerly known as 'Stop Staring At Boring New Tabs')** 😉

Hey there, time traveler! 🚀 Ever feel like time's just... *slipping* away? Want your new tab page to be less 'meh' 😑 and more 'WHOA'? Then you've landed in the right cosmic spot!

**Count till End** transforms your boring new tab page into a mesmerizing, dynamic countdown to YOUR most awaited moment! 🗓️⏰

## 🤔 So, What's the Big Deal?

This ain't your grandma's countdown timer (no offense, grandmas! ❤️). We're talking:

* A **gorgeous, dancing gradient background** that makes time *look* like it's flowing.
* A super smooth **water ripple effect** following your cursor – poke the time stream! 💧
* A **crystal-clear countdown** showing everything from years down to the zippy milliseconds!
* **YOU** set the target date, time, and name. Your countdown, your rules! 🎯

Basically, it makes staring at your browser feel a little more epic and reminds you that *stuff is happening*.

## 🌟 Features That Rock 🌟

* **New Tab Takeover:** Replaces your default new tab page with this beauty.
* **The Full Countdown:** Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and yes, even Milliseconds! 😱
* **Set Your Destiny:** Easily set any future date and time using the sleek settings panel. What are *you* counting down to?
* **Live Animated Background:** Multi-layered gradients flow and shift, creating a unique vibe every time. ✨
* **Water Ripple Magic:** Move your mouse and watch subtle ripples spread across the background. So zen! (Or maybe just fun? 🤔) 💧
* **Poppins Font Goodness:** Smooth, clean Poppins font for maximum readability and style points. 😎
* **Hidden Settings:** A tiny gear icon ⚙️ is your portal to setting things up. Keeps the main view clean!

## 🚀 Get It Running! (Installation)

Since this is fresh out of the oven (and maybe your VS Code), you'll load it manually:

1.  Download or save all the extension files (`manifest.json`, `html`, `css`, `js`, `icons` folder) into one dedicated folder on your computer. 📁
2.  Open your Chrome/Edge browser and go to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`).
3.  Flick the **"Developer mode"** switch (usually top-right) ON. ✅
4.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5.  Navigate to where you saved the extension folder, **single-click** to highlight the folder, and hit "Select Folder".
6.  BAM! ✨ Open a new tab and behold the glory!

*(Firefox users: Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click "Load Temporary Add-on", and select the `manifest.json` file inside your folder).*

## ⚙️ How to Use

1.  Open a new tab. Wowza! 😍
2.  See that tiny gear icon ⚙️ probably hiding in a corner? Click it!
3.  A panel should pop up. Use the date/time picker to set your target moment.
4.  Give your countdown a name (e.g., "Pizza Time!", "World Domination", "Nap").
5.  Save it! The countdown should now be running towards your goal.

## 💻 Techie Bits (Built With)
